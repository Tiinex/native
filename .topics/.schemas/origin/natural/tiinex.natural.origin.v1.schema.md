# Natural Origin

- Status: draft schema note

## Summary

This schema defines natural origin artifacts.

A natural origin is an origin whose reusable boundary is a natural, physical, environmental, ecological, geological, biological, climatic, spatial, or field-world context.

A natural origin may be a forest, river, field site, garden, watershed, mountain path, coast, soil layer, weather event, habitat, species observation context, laboratory sample context, sensor location, or any other natural or physical context where observations, traces, materials, or signals may be encountered.

A natural origin is not automatically captured by a note, photo, sensor log, map, sample, scan, or digital record. Those are encounters, interfaces, adapters, or preserved materials. The origin remains the world-side boundary.

## Schema Validation Contract

### Natural Origin Scope

Applies To

- artifacts whose `Current -> Current Schema` is `tiinex.natural.v1.origin`

Rules

- `tiinex.natural.v1.origin` identifies origin definitions whose boundary is natural, physical, environmental, ecological, biological, geological, climatic, spatial, or field-world.
- Natural origin definitions inherit ordinary origin boundaries and must keep place, event, organism, condition, trace, sample, observation, capture, preservation, and interpretation distinct.
- Natural origin definitions may be referenced by field procedures, sensors, cameras, lab protocols, maps, digital adapters, evidence artifacts, and LLM review workflows.
- Natural origin definitions are not field observations, evidence artifacts, consent records, validation results, sample custody records, or truth ledgers by themselves.
- Prose outside `Schema Validation Contract` may explain the schema, but it does not add required validation rules.

### Parent Origin Specialization

Rules

- Natural origin definitions inherit the origin-definition principle that identity, access boundary, material boundary, mutability, authority limits, privacy limits, stewardship limits, and interpretation limits must remain explicit.
- Natural origin definitions specialize the inherited `Origin Body` for artifacts whose `Current -> Current Schema` is `tiinex.natural.v1.origin`.
- The natural origin body replaces the parent origin body sections for `tiinex.natural.v1.origin` artifacts.
- `Natural Origin Identity` specializes `Origin Identity`.
- `Natural Boundary` specializes `Origin Boundary`.
- `Observation And Material Boundary` specializes `Material And Signal Boundary`.
- `Access Safety And Stewardship Boundary` specializes `Access And Authority Boundary`.
- `Change And Loss` specializes `Mutability And Loss`.
- `Use With Tools Interfaces And Adapters`, `Failure And Ambiguity Handling`, and `Portability Notes` preserve the corresponding parent origin semantics.
- Parent origin specialization applies to the artifact body only; it does not alter root continuity, integrity, or parent-origin requirements.

Inheritance Overrides

- natural-origin-body-structure
  - Merge Operation: override
  - Parent Schema: tiinex.origin.v1
  - Parent Node: Schema Validation Contract / Origin Body / Required Shape
  - Child Node: Schema Validation Contract / Natural Origin Body / Required Shape
  - Reason: This child schema replaces the inherited parent artifact-body structure while retaining compatible non-structural parent semantics and provenance.
  - Effective Result: The child Required Shape is authoritative for artifacts qualified against this schema; parent-only structural body groups become inactive, while compatible parent contributions targeting surviving child sections remain active.

- `<natural-origin-slug>.origin.md`
- `<natural-origin-slug>-origin.md`
- `<lineage>-natural-origin.trace.md`
- `<lineage>-<natural-origin-slug>.trace.md`

Rules

- `tiinex.natural.v1.origin.md` is the reserved base natural origin contract filename for the `tiinex.natural.v1.origin` origin family.
- Natural origin artifacts should use a slug that identifies the place, ecosystem, field context, natural process, sample context, environmental boundary, or natural origin family.
- Canonical registry-like natural origin definitions may use `.origin.md` when the artifact is intentionally maintained as a reusable origin definition.
- Trace-lineage natural origin artifacts should keep the `.trace.md` suffix stable.

### Interpretation Boundaries

Rules

- Use `tiinex.natural.v1.origin` to define natural-origin boundaries, not to record one observation or sample result.
- Field observations, samples, photographs, sensor logs, and lab results may reference a natural origin definition but should be owned by their own artifact schemas.
- A natural origin definition should not collapse place, observation, sample, sensor record, evidence, claim, or preservation into one thing.
- Natural-origin artifacts should help explorers stay honest about the difference between world, trail, map, note, sample, and claim.

## Artifact Creation Contract

### Creation Intent

Rules

- Create a natural origin artifact when defining a reusable natural, physical, environmental, ecological, field, sample, or place boundary.
- Do not create a natural origin artifact merely to record one observation, photo, or sensor value.

### Parent Selection

Rules

- A base natural origin contract should parent the base origin contract.
- A concrete natural origin should parent the nearest broader natural origin contract.
- A local field observation should usually be a discovery finding, evidence artifact, or field trace rather than a reusable natural origin definition.

### Creation Checks

Rules

- Declare natural origin identity, boundary, observation/material boundary, access/safety/stewardship, change/loss, tool/interface/adapter use, and failure handling.
- Keep natural origin, observation, sample, capture, preservation, evidence, and truth separate.
- Mark safety, permission, stewardship, non-disturbance, uncertainty, and staleness limits when relevant.

### Recommended Output

Rules

- Use a human-readable origin name.
- Include enough structured fields for humans, tools, and LLMs to avoid unsafe or overbroad interpretation.
- Prefer bounded field contexts over vague claims about nature as a whole.

### Not Recommended

Rules

- Do not use natural origin artifacts as permission to access, disturb, collect, sample, publish, or generalize.
- Do not use natural origin artifacts as proof of species, condition, event, environmental claim, evidence, validation, or preservation.

# Field Observation Site Natural Origin

## Natural Origin Identity

- Name: field observation site natural origin
- Version: 1
- Origin Family: field observation site
- Canonical Identifier: field.observation.site.v1
- Base Origin: tiinex.v1.origin
- Natural Origin Medium: natural field-world
- Natural Origin Scope: bounded place and time window for observation

## Natural Boundary

- In Scope: declared field site and observation window
- Out Of Scope: nearby habitats, private property, broader population claims, and unstated seasons
- Boundary Type: spatial and temporal field boundary
- Boundary Stability: changing and weather-dependent

## Observation And Material Boundary

- Possible Observation Or Material: direct observation, traces, photographs, sensor readings, notes, or samples when permitted
- Observation Or Material Status: observed, partial, sampled, photographed, preserved, unavailable, inferred, or unknown
- Does Not Prove: population truth, species certainty, ownership, permission, safety, or environmental conclusion

## Access Safety And Stewardship Boundary

- Access Modes: non-disturbing observation, permitted sampling, camera, sensor, or local report
- Safety Boundary: do not access unsafe conditions silently
- Stewardship Boundary: respect property, conservation, community, and non-disturbance limits
- User Action Requirements: permission, sampling, publication, or preservation when relevant

## Change And Loss

- Change Modes: weather, season, movement, growth, decay, disturbance, or human activity
- Loss Modes: missed observation, degraded sample, sensor failure, lost context, or access change
- Staleness Risk: depends on organism, condition, weather, and time window

## Use With Tools Interfaces And Adapters

- Tool Use: field notebook, map, camera, sensor, sample kit, or viewer
- Interface Use: field visit, camera, sensor, lab bench, or local report
- Adapter Use: convert observations or records into findings/candidates with uncertainty preserved
- Preservation Boundary: encounter or capture is not durable preservation unless explicitly preserved

## Failure And Ambiguity Handling

- Failure Modes: unsafe access, partial observation, misidentification, disturbance, contamination, sensor failure, or missing context
- Ambiguity Modes: similar species, old traces, changing conditions, indirect reports, or biased sampling
- Safe Representation: show uncertainty and limits rather than inventing missing natural state
```

## Validation-Friendly Shape

Keep this schema note in the exact section order already used here: `Summary`, `Schema Validation Contract`, `Artifact Creation Contract`, `Minimal Example`, `Validation-Friendly Shape`, and `Interpretation Notes`.

Maintain the section headings exactly in this schema note. Free markdown inside those sections is allowed, but adding undeclared new section headings should be treated as schema drift.

## Interpretation Notes

- natural origins define world-side boundaries, not observations by themselves
- digital records of nature may need both natural-origin and digital-origin boundaries
- field tools, sensors, cameras, notebooks, maps, adapters, and LLM runtimes should keep natural uncertainty visible
- the explorer needs both a map and humility: the map is not the terrain, and one observation is not the whole place
