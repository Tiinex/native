# Digital Origin

- Status: draft schema note

## Summary

This schema defines digital origin artifacts.

A digital origin is an origin whose reusable boundary is formed by digital records, digital surfaces, digital storage, digital identity, digital transport, digital access rules, digital rendering, digital exports, or digital runtime state.

It is not limited to software development. A digital origin may be a repository host, issue tracker, discussion forum, social platform, professional network, public web page, document store, local folder, exported archive, dataset, sensor stream, camera trap archive, satellite image set, museum catalog, chat export, or LLM runtime transcript.

The important boundary is this: a digital origin is a digital place or record surface where material may be encountered. It is not the same thing as the person, community, ecosystem, event, place, object, organization, or truth that the record may discuss or represent.

## Schema Validation Contract

### Digital Origin Scope

Applies To

- artifacts whose `Current -> Current Schema` is `tiinex.digital.v1.origin`

Rules

- `tiinex.digital.v1.origin` identifies origin definitions whose boundary is digital or digital-mediated.
- Digital origin definitions inherit ordinary origin boundaries and must keep digital surface, represented subject, access state, material state, preservation state, and interpretation state distinct.
- Digital origin definitions may be referenced by digital adapters, viewers, validators, LLM runtimes, archives, and human review procedures.
- Digital origin definitions are not digital adapter implementations, platform API contracts, evidence ledgers, consent records, identity records, or truth authorities.
- Prose outside `Schema Validation Contract` may explain the schema, but it does not add required validation rules.

### Parent Origin Specialization

Rules

- Digital origin definitions inherit the origin-definition principle that identity, access boundary, material boundary, mutability, authority limits, privacy limits, and interpretation limits must remain explicit.
- Digital origin definitions specialize the inherited `Origin Body` for artifacts whose `Current -> Current Schema` is `tiinex.digital.v1.origin`.
- The digital origin body replaces the parent origin body sections for `tiinex.digital.v1.origin` artifacts.
- `Digital Origin Identity` specializes `Origin Identity`.
- `Digital Boundary` specializes `Origin Boundary`.
- `Digital Material Boundary` specializes `Material And Signal Boundary`.
- `Access And Policy Boundary` specializes `Access And Authority Boundary`.
- `Mutability And Rendering` specializes `Mutability And Loss`.
- `Use With Digital Adapters`, `Failure And Ambiguity Handling`, and `Portability Notes` preserve the corresponding parent origin semantics.
- Parent origin specialization applies to the artifact body only; it does not alter root continuity, integrity, or parent-origin requirements.

Inheritance Overrides

- digital-origin-body-structure
  - Merge Operation: override
  - Parent Schema: tiinex.origin.v1
  - Parent Node: Schema Validation Contract / Origin Body / Required Shape
  - Child Node: Schema Validation Contract / Digital Origin Body / Required Shape
  - Reason: This child schema replaces the inherited parent artifact-body structure while retaining compatible non-structural parent semantics and provenance.
  - Effective Result: The child Required Shape is authoritative for artifacts qualified against this schema; parent-only structural body groups become inactive, while compatible parent contributions targeting surviving child sections remain active.

### File Naming

Allowed Shapes

- `tiinex.digital.v1.origin.md`
- `<digital-origin-slug>.origin.md`
- `<digital-origin-slug>-origin.md`
- `<lineage>-digital-origin.trace.md`
- `<lineage>-<digital-origin-slug>.trace.md`

Rules

- `tiinex.digital.v1.origin.md` is the reserved base digital origin contract filename for the `tiinex.digital.v1.origin` origin family.
- Digital origin artifacts should use a slug that identifies the digital origin family, host, platform, collection, document store, runtime, dataset, archive, or source surface.
- Canonical registry-like digital origin definitions may use `.origin.md` when the artifact is intentionally maintained as a reusable origin definition.
- Trace-lineage digital origin artifacts should keep the `.trace.md` suffix stable.

### Interpretation Boundaries

Rules

- Use `tiinex.digital.v1.origin` to define digital origin boundaries, not to implement digital adapters.
- Digital adapters may reference digital origin definitions, but adapter behavior remains declared in adapter artifacts.
- Access to a digital origin does not imply preservation, consent, identity, authorship, representativeness, authority, evidence, or truth.
- Digital records about the natural or physical world remain records about the world, not the world itself.

## Artifact Creation Contract

### Creation Intent

Rules

- Create a digital origin artifact when defining a reusable digital source boundary, platform family, repository host, social surface, professional network surface, public web community, document store, archive, dataset, runtime, local file set, or digital record family.
- Do not create a digital origin artifact merely because an artifact contains a URL.

### Parent Selection

Rules

- A base digital origin contract should parent the base origin contract.
- A concrete digital origin should parent the nearest broader digital origin contract.
- A local observation of one digital item should usually be a discovery finding or evidence artifact, not a reusable digital origin definition.

### Creation Checks

Rules

- Declare digital origin identity, boundary, material boundary, access/policy boundary, mutability/rendering, adapter use, and failure handling.
- Keep digital record, represented subject, adapter result, preserved material, evidence, and truth separate.
- Mark public/private/auth/policy/rate-limit/personalization/mutability limits when relevant.

### Recommended Output

Rules

- Use a human-readable origin name.
- Include enough structured fields for adapters and LLMs to avoid silent scope broadening.
- Prefer concrete, bounded origins over vague platform-wide claims.

### Not Recommended

Rules

- Do not use digital origin artifacts as proof of content, truth, authorship, consent, identity, authority, validation, or preservation.
- Do not treat a visible page, post, API response, or export as preserved material unless preservation is explicit.

# Repository Collaboration Digital Origin

## Digital Origin Identity

- Name: repository collaboration digital origin
- Version: 1
- Origin Family: repository collaboration
- Canonical Identifier: repository.collaboration.v1
- Base Origin: tiinex.v1.origin
- Digital Origin Medium: digital-social repository collaboration
- Digital Origin Scope: bounded repository issue, discussion, pull request, or comment surface

## Digital Boundary

- In Scope: declared repository collaboration target
- Out Of Scope: unrelated repositories, unrelated accounts, private data, secrets, hidden organization data, or platform-wide search by default
- Boundary Type: repository-defined and platform-defined digital-social boundary
- Scope Broadening Rule: explicit user action required

## Digital Material Boundary

- Digital Material: visible title, body, comments, metadata, source URL, and availability status
- Represented Subject: project collaboration around a declared repository target
- Material Status: observed, unavailable, partial, stale, cached, preserved, auth-scoped, policy-scoped, or unknown
- Does Not Prove: truth, consent, identity, acceptance, priority, task ownership, evidence, or preservation

## Access And Policy Boundary

- Access Modes: visible page, API, export, or user-provided capture
- Access Limits: bounded target only
- Policy Boundary: respect host access, rate-limit, and policy signals
- User Action Requirements: authentication, preservation, write-back, publication, or scope broadening

## Mutability And Rendering

- Mutability: material can be edited, deleted, hidden, locked, or rate-limited
- Rendering Variance: visibility and rendering may vary by account, permission, API, browser, or time
- Staleness Risk: high for live collaboration material
- Loss Modes: deletion, edit, moderation, API drift, missing context, or access change

## Use With Digital Adapters

- Recommended Adapter Use: create bounded discovery findings and candidates
- Preservation Boundary: cache or render is not preservation
- Candidate Output Boundary: feedback/task/evidence/resource/pointer candidates require review
- Not Automatic Outputs: truth, evidence, consent, identity, priority, task, feedback, or preserved material

## Failure And Ambiguity Handling

- Failure Modes: unavailable, private, forbidden, rate-limited, deleted, stale, partial, or unsupported target
- Ambiguity Modes: quotes, edits, bots, minimization, missing context, or mirrored material
- Safe Representation: visible gap/status with source identity and limits
```

## Validation-Friendly Shape

Keep this schema note in the exact section order already used here: `Summary`, `Schema Validation Contract`, `Artifact Creation Contract`, `Minimal Example`, `Validation-Friendly Shape`, and `Interpretation Notes`.

Maintain the section headings exactly in this schema note. Free markdown inside those sections is allowed, but adding undeclared new section headings should be treated as schema drift.

## Interpretation Notes

- digital origins define reusable digital source boundaries
- digital origins include more than software development: communities, archives, public web, documents, runtime logs, datasets, sensor records, scanned paper, and digital records of nature all fit when the origin boundary is digital
- digital adapters should reference digital origins to avoid mixing platform rules with adapter output mapping
- Reddit, LinkedIn, GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues, forums, document stores, and field-camera archives can share digital-origin discipline while still needing concrete origin definitions later
- a digital record can guide discovery, but it is not automatically preserved material or evidence
