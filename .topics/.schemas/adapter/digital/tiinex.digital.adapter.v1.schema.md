# Digital Adapter

- Status: draft schema note

## Summary

This schema defines digital adapter artifacts.

A digital adapter is an adapter whose boundary crosses a digital surface, digital record, digital platform, digital transport, digital identity, digital storage, digital export, or digital runtime.

It is not a software-development-only concept. A digital adapter may support a repository issue tracker, public discussion forum, professional network, web page, exported archive, scanned paper, camera image, sensor log, satellite image, field recorder, museum catalog, dataset, document store, or LLM runtime transcript.

The important boundary is this: a digital adapter works with digital material about something. It must not silently treat the digital material as the thing itself. A camera record of a forest is not the forest. A sensor log of a river is not the river. A social post about a person is not the person. A GitHub comment about work is not automatically feedback, evidence, consent, or task ownership.

## Schema Validation Contract

### Digital Adapter Scope

Applies To

- artifacts whose `Current -> Current Schema` is `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter`

Rules

- `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter` identifies adapter definitions whose source boundary, operating boundary, or transport boundary is digital.
- Digital adapter artifacts inherit the ordinary adapter boundary: fetched, accessed, cached, rendered, or held material is not automatically preserved material.
- Digital adapter artifacts must keep digital-source identity, access method, material status, preservation status, and interpretation status distinct.
- Digital adapters should be usable by humans, LLMs, browser apps, CLIs, extensions, runtimes, field workflows, research workflows, and review tools without requiring one programming language.
- Prose outside `Schema Validation Contract` may explain the schema, but it does not add required validation rules.

### Parent Adapter Specialization

Rules

- Digital adapter definitions inherit the adapter-definition principle that source boundaries, translation boundaries, access discipline, holding, preservation, output mapping, user action, failure handling, and portability must remain explicit.
- Digital adapter definitions specialize the inherited `Adapter Body` for artifacts whose `Current -> Current Schema` is `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter`.
- The digital adapter body replaces the parent adapter body sections for `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter` artifacts.
- `Digital Adapter Identity` specializes `Adapter Identity`.
- `Digital Source Boundary` and `Digital Material Boundary` specialize `Source Boundary` and `Translation Boundary`.
- `Transport And Access Discipline` specializes `Access And Intake Discipline`.
- `Cache And Preservation Boundary` specializes `Holding And Reuse Discipline` and `Preservation Boundary`.
- `Output Mapping`, `User Action Boundary`, `Failure And Gap Handling`, and `Portability Notes` preserve the corresponding parent adapter semantics.
- Parent adapter specialization applies to the artifact body only; it does not alter root continuity, integrity, or parent-origin requirements.

Inheritance Overrides

- digital-adapter-body-structure
  - Merge Operation: override
  - Parent Schema: tiinex.adapter.v1
  - Parent Node: Schema Validation Contract / Adapter Body / Required Shape
  - Child Node: Schema Validation Contract / Digital Adapter Body / Required Shape
  - Reason: This child schema replaces the inherited parent artifact-body structure while retaining compatible non-structural parent semantics and provenance.
  - Effective Result: The child Required Shape is authoritative for artifacts qualified against this schema; parent-only structural body groups become inactive, while compatible parent contributions targeting surviving child sections remain active.

- Digital adapter output must not silently become feedback, task, evidence, consent, acceptance, validation, proof, authorship, identity, priority, ownership, or truth.
- Stronger use requires explicit interpretation, such as `Use as` or `Create from finding`, unless the concrete adapter schema declares a stricter human-reviewed flow.
- Output mapping should preserve status labels such as observed, unavailable, partial, stale, rate-limited, auth-scoped, policy-scoped, or needs review.

- Preserve Boundary
- Consent Boundary

### Portability Notes

Required Fields

- Portable Contract
- Implementation Freedom
- Human Readability
- Machine Readability

Optional Fields

- Browser Notes
- CLI Notes
- Extension Notes
- Runtime Notes
- Offline Notes
- Field Workflow Notes

Rules

- Digital adapter definitions must remain readable by people without requiring access to the implementation code.
- Implementations may vary by app, CLI, extension, runtime, notebook, field workflow, or review tool if they preserve the declared boundaries.
- A digital adapter definition is not executable code and is not a log of one adapter run.

### File Naming

Allowed Shapes

- `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter.md`
- `<digital-adapter-slug>.adapter.md`
- `<origin>.<capability>.v1.adapter.md`
- `<origin>.<surface>.<capability>.v1.adapter.md`
- `<lineage>-digital-adapter.trace.md`
- `<lineage>-<digital-adapter-slug>.trace.md`

Rules

- `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter.md` is the reserved base digital adapter contract filename for the `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter` family.
- Digital adapter artifacts should use a slug that identifies the origin, surface, or capability without hiding the adapter role.
- Concrete origin adapters may use `.adapter.md` when they are intentionally maintained as reusable adapter definitions.
- Trace-lineage digital adapter artifacts should keep the `.trace.md` suffix stable.

### Interpretation Boundaries

Rules

- Use `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter` to define digital adapter behavior, not to record one adapter run.
- A specific adapter run may reference a digital adapter artifact but should be recorded by a runtime, traversal, discovery, or other result-owning schema.
- Digital adapter definitions should not become platform-specific policy mirrors; they should declare the boundary and point to source-specific docs when needed.
- Platform-specific adapters should inherit digital adapter constraints and then narrow the origin surface.

## Artifact Creation Contract

### Creation Scope

Rules

- Create `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter` artifacts when defining a reusable digital adapter contract or a concrete digital adapter that inherits the digital boundary.
- Do not create `tiinex.digital.v1.adapter` artifacts merely to record that a digital source was visited, viewed, cached, or fetched.

### Creation Inputs

Required Fields

- adapter name
- version
- canonical identifier
- base adapter reference
- digital source boundary
- transport and access discipline
- cache and preservation boundary
- output mapping
- user action boundary
- failure and gap handling

### Default Behaviors

Rules

- adapters are read-only unless write behavior is explicitly declared
- access is bounded by declared source inputs
- preservation requires explicit user action
- stronger interpretation requires explicit use-as or human review
- unavailable material remains visible as a gap

### Creation Warnings

Rules

- do not collapse source URL, fetched material, cached material, preserved material, and evidence into one field
- do not treat social-platform posts as consent, identity, or representative truth
- do not treat digital nature records as the natural event itself
- do not infer unseen comments, hidden posts, private material, deleted edits, or missing pages
- do not encode one platform-specific quirk as a universal digital adapter rule unless it is truly medium-wide

## Validation-Friendly Shape

Keep this schema note in the exact section order already used here:
`Summary`, `Schema Validation Contract`, `Artifact Creation Contract`, `Minimal Example`,
`Validation-Friendly Shape`, and `Interpretation Notes`.

Maintain the section headings exactly in this schema note. Free markdown inside
those sections is allowed, but adding undeclared new section headings should be
treated as schema drift.

## Interpretation Notes

- digital adapters are medium-specific adapters, not software-development-only adapters
- digital records may describe physical, natural, social, legal, runtime, or project events without becoming those events
- platform community origins such as GitHub Discussions, Reddit, LinkedIn, forums, chat exports, and public comment systems should share digital adapter constraints before adding origin-specific rules
- natural-world origins such as wildlife cameras, field sensors, satellite imagery, lab instruments, and citizen-science observations may also use digital adapter constraints when the intake crosses a digital record boundary
- concrete digital adapters should be narrow about source scope and generous about human readability
- do not silently promote digital findings into feedback, tasks, evidence, consent, or truth
