# Consent Instrument

- Status: maintained schema note

## Summary

This schema narrows `tiinex.instrument.v1` for artifacts whose main job is to preserve an explicit consent, permission, refusal, withdrawal, restriction, or use-boundary instrument.

It replaces the earlier PoC placement of consent under attestation by treating consent as a terms-bearing instrument. A consent instrument may still reference attestation when the main value is who witnessed, stated, signed, or vouched for the consent-related statement.

A consent instrument does not prove identity, legal compliance, clinical correctness, provenance, or byte integrity by itself. It preserves the declared permission or refusal boundary so later readers and tools do not infer consent from silence, convenience, or app defaults.

## Schema Validation Contract

### Consent Instrument Scope

Applies To

- artifacts whose `Current -> Current Schema` is `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1`

Rules

- `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1` identifies instrument-derived artifacts centered on consent, refusal, withdrawal, permission, restriction, or allowed use.
- A consent instrument artifact records that a party, delegate, guardian, organization, authority, or bounded descriptor made or is represented as making a scoped consent-related statement.
- A consent instrument artifact should state consent type, consent status, consenting party or authority, scope, use boundary, revocation or expiry, and interpretation limits.
- A consent instrument artifact must not imply identity, legal compliance, clinical correctness, provenance, receipt, or byte integrity unless those claims are separately supported by appropriate artifacts or methods.
- Prose outside `Schema Validation Contract` may explain the schema, but it does not add required validation rules.

### Parent Body Specialization

Rules

- `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1` specializes the inherited `Instrument Body`.
- The child body replaces the parent body sections for artifacts whose current schema is `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1`.
- `Consent Statement` specializes `Instrument Identity`, `Terms Or Permissions`, and consent-related status.
- `Consenting Party` specializes `Parties Or Authorities`.
- `Consent Scope` and `Use Boundary` specialize `Terms Or Permissions` and `Boundaries`.
- `Revocation Or Expiry` specializes `Status And Effect`.
- `Interpretation Limits` preserves inherited limits and prevents treating consent as legal compliance, identity proof, or broad permission by default.

Inheritance Overrides

- instrument-consent-body-structure
  - Merge Operation: override
  - Parent Schema: tiinex.instrument.v1
  - Parent Node: Schema Validation Contract / Instrument Body / Required Shape
  - Child Node: Schema Validation Contract / Consent Instrument Body / Required Shape
  - Reason: This child schema replaces the inherited parent artifact-body structure while retaining compatible non-structural parent semantics and provenance.
  - Effective Result: The child Required Shape is authoritative for artifacts qualified against this schema; parent-only structural body groups become inactive, while compatible parent contributions targeting surviving child sections remain active.

### Consent Instrument Body

Required Shape

- first body heading after the continuity envelope
- `## Consent Statement` section
- `## Consenting Party` section

Rules

- A consent instrument artifact should begin with a human-readable title.
- `Consent Statement` must state the consent-related statement being preserved.
- `Consenting Party` must identify the consenting party, role, delegate, guardian, authority, or bounded descriptor as specifically as the artifact can safely disclose.
- `Consent Scope` must state the bounded purpose, target, and allowed or prohibited use.
- `Use Boundary` must state what use, sharing, serialization, retention, or disclosure limits apply.
- `Revocation Or Expiry` must state expiry and revocation status, even when they are unknown or not declared.
- `Interpretation Limits` must state what the consent instrument should not be read as proving.

- Applies To
- Allowed Uses
- Prohibited Uses

Optional Fields

- Jurisdiction Or Policy Context

Rules

### Revocation Or Expiry

Required Fields

- Expiry
- Revocation Status

Optional Fields

- Revocation Path

Rules

- `Expiry` must state a date, condition, `not-declared`, or `unknown`.
- `Revocation Status` must use one of the declared shapes.
- If revocation is possible but the revocation path is unknown, the artifact should say so explicitly.
- Consent should not be treated as permanent unless permanence is inside the declared statement and trust boundary.

### File Naming

Allowed Shapes

- `<lineage>.trace.md`

- The optional slug should identify the consent target, purpose, or consent class.
- Consent instrument artifacts should keep the `.trace.md` suffix stable.

### Interpretation Boundaries

Rules

- Use `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1` when the main artifact value is permission, refusal, withdrawal, restriction, or use-boundary consent semantics.
- Do not use `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1` as a substitute for privacy boundary artifacts when the main value is sensitivity, sharing, or serialization policy.
- Do not use `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1` as a substitute for attestation when the main value is a scoped witness, review, signoff, identity, or authority statement rather than the consent boundary itself.
- Do not use `tiinex.instrument.consent.v1` to claim legal compliance without supporting legal, policy, evidence, or attestation artifacts.
- Consent instruments may reference privacy boundary, attestation, relation, external payload, validation method, or evidence artifacts when those artifacts define the consent context.

- Current
  - Current Schema: tiinex.instrument.consent.v1
  - Created At: 2026-06-29 00:00:00
  - Summary: Consent boundary for summary-only use of one private lab payload.

- Consent Type: data-use-consent
- Consent Status: active
- Target Payload: private-lab-result-payload.trace.md

## Consenting Party

- Party: bounded authorized representative descriptor
- Role Or Authority: subject-authorized representative

## Consent Scope

- Purpose: internal review of one lab result package
- Applies To: private lab result payload artifact
- Allowed Uses: bounded internal summary

- Sharing Boundary: restricted
- Serialization Boundary: raw payload details disabled

## Revocation Or Expiry

- Expiry: unknown
- Revocation Status: unknown
- Revocation Path: not recorded in this artifact

## Interpretation Limits

- Interpretation Limits: this artifact does not prove legal compliance, subject identity, payload integrity, or clinical correctness
```

## Validation-Friendly Shape

Keep this maintained schema note in the exact section order already used here:
`Summary`, `Schema Validation Contract`, `Minimal Example`,
`Validation-Friendly Shape`, `Interpretation Notes`, and
`Artifact Creation Contract`.

Maintain the section headings exactly in this schema note. Free markdown inside
those sections is allowed, but adding undeclared new section headings should be
treated as schema drift.

## Interpretation Notes

- consent is now modeled as an instrument child rather than an attestation child in this PoC refactor
- consent instruments preserve permission, refusal, withdrawal, restriction, or allowed-use boundaries
- attestation remains available as a companion artifact when the main value is who vouched, signed, witnessed, or asserted the consent statement
- consent should remain separate from privacy boundary, redaction, evidence, integrity, and legal compliance unless those companion artifacts are explicitly referenced

## Artifact Creation Contract

### Prompt Fields

Required Fields

- version
- createTitle
- summaryPrompt
- summaryPlaceholder

Optional Fields

- whyPrompt
- whyPlaceholder

Rules

- The current consent instrument create surface uses version `1`.
- `createTitle` should label the create action as `Create Consent Instrument`.
- `summaryPrompt` should ask for the consent boundary title.
- `summaryPlaceholder` should guide the user toward the permission, refusal, withdrawal, or use boundary.

### Template Body

Required Shape

- first heading uses `# {summary}`
- `## Consent Statement` section
- `## Consenting Party` section
- `## Consent Scope` section
- `## Use Boundary` section
- `## Revocation Or Expiry` section
- `## Interpretation Limits` section

Rules

- Generated consent instrument artifacts should begin with the consent title as the first body heading.
- Generated consent instrument artifacts should preserve the consent boundary without inferring permission from silence.
